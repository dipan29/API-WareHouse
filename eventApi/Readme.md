# Web Scraping API for Event Fetching
This will be similar to API 1 but in this case it will pull event details from various sites like [BookMyShow](#), [PayTM Insider](#) and other similar ticket or event booking platforms.  
It will fetch important information like **Price**, **Event Name**, **Ticket URL**, **Location**, **Event Type** and other relevant details.
